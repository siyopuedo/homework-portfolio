      <h3>Experience</h3>
      I began my email career in San Diego that had fortunately led me to live and work in Madrid for 3 years. My international experience not only grew my professional career, but also my personal growth. I learned basic Spanish, I was able to communicate effectively with teams in both the US and Spain and I adapted to an entire new culture.
