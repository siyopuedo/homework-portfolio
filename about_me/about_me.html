        Hola, my name is Margaux! 
        I currently work in the Email sector for a tech company based out of L.A. I've worked in Email for about eight years now starting in San Diego to then expanding into Madrid for a few years. Throughout my career in email,
        I gained the skillset to be able to read and modify the code on templates. Therefore, for me learning FEWD is what I need to tie all my email template experience together while also gaining valuable skills for more opportunities in the digital world.
